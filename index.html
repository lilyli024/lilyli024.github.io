<h1>Validation of Climate Hazards Center's CHIRPS Data</h1>
<h2>Comparing CHIRPS 2.0 to OSU's PRISM</h2>
<p> By validating against Oregon State Univeristy's widely used PRISM data set, newer, more refined versions of CHIRPS can made. Unlike CHIRPS 2.0, PRISM has a finer 4x4 resolution, is based only on ground stations, and contains only US data. Due to differing spatial resolutions, we used linear interpolation to create a continuous surface from discrete coordinate points for PRISM.</p>
